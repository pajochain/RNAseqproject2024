Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data for Trichomonas tenax-treated NCI-H292 cells. T. tenax is a neglected tropical disease that affects oral cavities of people around the world.


This analysis project seeks to determine which genes are over expressed in cells treated with T.tenax and what are the potential consequences of the expression profile.
